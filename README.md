Container Bridge Instance Installation:

1). Clone this repo into a Linux instance that supports docker images

2). cd into the cloned repo and run: ./run-reload-bridge.sh

Once the container instance is live, you must configure the bridge and bind it between your mbed Pelion account and your IoTHub Account in Azure. 

1). Please go to your Azure dashboard and create an IoTHub instance.

2). From your IoTHub dashboard in Azure, copy to your clipboard your IoTHub's "iothubowner" primary key connection string. Record the connection string.

3). Next go to https://os.mbed.com and create your mbed Account. You can then request a Pelion developer account using the same credentials at https://portal.us-east-1.mbedcloud.com

4). Once your Pelion account is created, you need to "Access Keys" to create a Pelion API Key/Token. Record the Token Value

Now that you have your:

    - IoTHub "iothubowner" primary key connection string

    - Pelion API Key/Token generated

Go to:  https://[[your containers public IP address]]:8234

    - username: "admin" (no quotes)

    - password: "admin" (no quotes)

Enter both your IoTHub "iothubowner" connection string and the Pelion API Token

    - Please press "SAVE" after *each* is entered... 

    - After both are entered and saved, press "RESTART"

Your Pelion bridge should now be configured and operational.
